The International Succession Planning Association is dedicated to the promotion, empowerment and expansion of the succession planning environment. The goal of the ISPA® is to provide professionals, not exclusively dedicated to succession planning, with unique resources that add value to their core services within the business consulting market.

## Mission

Through providing advanced education, building a network of like-minded professionals and providing access to unique business technology, the mission of the ISPA® is to strategically and globally improve succession planning practices and philosophies.

## Business Succession Planning

Fundamentally, business succession planning is a transitional, not a transactional, process that focuses on the appropriate transfer and successful long-term continuity of an operating business through the next generation of owners, leaders and managers. This process is not just about basic estate planning or profits, but is highly dependent upon addressing multiple, interdependent, long-term performance factors known as the Succession Matrix®.
