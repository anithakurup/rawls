The Succession Planning Assessment® (SPA™), is a web-based tool, developed by practitioners in the field, for business advisors motivated to add value to their core services through succession planning consulting services. This comprehensive assessment and planning tool allows an advisor to identify and develop a plan to address critical issues impacting a business’ performance, value and longevity positioning them to facilitate solutions to the identified needs.

## How it works ##

* Accessed online, the SPA™ is designed to assist an advisor in evaluating a business owner’s readiness for succession through a comprehensive series of questions that evaluates the critical components of business success and continuity.
* The assessment structure provides an in-depth interview process that motivates discussion regarding the intricacies between business and financial structuring, family issues, personal goals and management strength.
* Upon completing the data gathering portion of the tool, the SPA™ system generates a report, graphically illustrating where the business stands on each of the critical planning factors impacting business succession, as well as an Action Agenda, highlighting the areas in need of improvement.
* The planning platform provides the first step in an on-going, collaborative consulting process between the advisor team and their client as they overcome the roadblocks of succession.
